# Who Dares

"Who Dares" is the working title of my entry to the 43rd Ludum Dare Compo.

## What?
I dunno yet! The jam hasn't started!

## How?
Using my crystal ball, I can say before I've even started that I will use at least one of these tools:

| Purpose  | Tool                                |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| Engine   | Godot Engine v3.1 alpha 2           |
| Graphics | Aesprite, GIMP, Blender             |
| SFX      | LabChirp, Audacity, Mouthsounds(TM) |

## Can I...?
Probably! "Who Dares" uses the MIT License, so you're free to do just about anything you want with it.
Check the LICENSE file for more information.
